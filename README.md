Computer Vision Wiz: You'll dive into computer vision techniques that use cameras to recognize hand movements, translating them into mouse actions on the screen.

Frontend:
In "background.py" the path of the image should be given proper
whereas in my program image is saved as "vm5.png" in D drive. 
So the path of the image will be 
image_path=PhotoImage(file="D:/vm5.png")
Where ever the image is but the image_path should be proper.

How to run
python background.py
