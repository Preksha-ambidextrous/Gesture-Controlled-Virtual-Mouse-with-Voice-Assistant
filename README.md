# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse-with-Voice-Assistant
Building a gesture control virtual mouse with voice assistant hones two key skills:

Multimodal Magic: You'll learn to design interfaces that understand both hand gestures and spoken commands, creating a more intuitive way to interact with computers.
Computer Vision Wiz: You'll dive into computer vision techniques that use cameras to recognize hand movements, translating them into mouse actions on the screen.
